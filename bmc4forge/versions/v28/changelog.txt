[Visuals Update]
FORGE MODLOADER IS NOW 47.3.1

Mods:
+ Added Yung Structures Addon for Loot Integration (by someaddon)
- Removed Endless Biomes (Caused many crashes and massive lag)

Configs:
- Added a quest for the Season Calendar
- Set the default render distance y-stretch to 400%. Feel free to lower this value in Video Settings for better performance.
- Heavily customized the default enabled config for the Euphoria Patches shaderpack so it works with the new colored lighting, alongside some other tweaks for a better experience.
- Increased the spawn rate of end cities by 150%. Keep in mind that end cities are unable to spawn on many modded blocks and are more common in vanilla biomes.
- VanilAA shaders are no longer enabled by default, as it caused issues for people on lower end GPUs. If you have a decent GPU then these shaders should still be fully compatible, and you will see much better graphics quality with it enabled and may even gain FPS.

Updates:
- Added 6 new structures (Philip's Ruins)
- Added a cooldown to Umvuthi's hurt animation to prevent him from getting stuck (Mowzies Mobs)
- Zooming now works when in third-person and will overall be a lot smoother (Just Zoom)
- Added Advanced Colored Lighting and Colored Light Fog, which allows for beautiful colored lighting to be created by light sources (Complementary Shaders)
- Added Carved Bases, which are a decorative block for the bottom of the walls in the bronze dungeon (Aether Redux)
- Added a new light block, the Runelight, which can be turned on/off with a right-click (Aether Redux)
- Added unique sky colors to some biomes (Aether Redux)
- Decreased the spawn rate of nagas (Mowzies Mobs)
- Entities hit by a torch or flint and steel will be set on fire (Amendments)

The following updates are specifically for when the Euphoria Patches shaderpack is enabled in Video Settings:
- Added custom properties to many modded blocks. The End and Nether dimensions are especially affected by this.
- Added a glitter rain shader option
- Added separate Border Fog settings (Distance and Density) for all dimensions
- Added a very beautiful End Crystal Vortex Option, alongside an ender dragon death animation
- Added a cloud render distance slider to control how far or near clouds will appear
- Added a new end portal effect
- Added a long exposure mode
- Added a tilt-shift option
- Added a waving sugar cane option
- End sky colors also change color in modded biomes now, amount can be changed with a slider
- Lava lakes in caves under y -55 in the Overworld will now also look like the nether lava lakes
