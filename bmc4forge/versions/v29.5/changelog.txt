Configs:
- Added tons of new quests and a new quest chapter
- Redesigned the main menu and loading screens to be much more clean and intuitive
- Dragons from Dragon Mounts Legacy can now change types based off their habitat again. This was initially disabled for balance, but user input has shown this caused a lot of confusion and made some dragons much harder to obtain.
- Fixed end generation being very square and end cities being hard to find due to BetterEnd glitch (Thanks liangmoe!)
- Improved completion detection of all Twilight Forest quests. This should prevent some quests not completing properly.
- Decreased Mowzies Mobs Naga spawn rates by 50%
- Bound Crawl to Left Alt, so typing Z in chat will not cause the player to crawl
- Disabled BCLib's custom fog rendering. This should fix the nether having very low visibility.
- Disabled Quark's Greener Grass feature. This means that, as seasons change ingame, you will now see the grass color change as well. (Thanks stubkan!)
- Enabled smallerRecipePacket in the Recipe Essentials config. This will reduce errors and make servers smoother for people on slow connections.
- Re-enabled Quark simple harvest, which fixes some plants not harvesting correctly
- Moved the JustZoom configuration button to the top right of the escape menu
- Added to the Trading Post quest description the crucial information that villagers follow you when you hold an emerald in hand
- Many small quest changes for clarity and balance

- Bound Ping to R
- Fixed the Game Menu text and the Player Reporting button moving when the window resizes
- Set the max Farsight render distance to 32
- Readded the custom Better MC window icon

- Disabled update checkers from several mods, which should decrease loading times and bandwith usage.
