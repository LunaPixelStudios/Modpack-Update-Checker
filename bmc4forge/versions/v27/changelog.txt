[Content Update]
**BEFORE UPDATING:**
Make sure to remove any Aether accessories/trinkets you have equipped **before **updating. If they are not removed from these slots, then they **will** get deleted permanently. They are safe to re-equip afterwards. Diagonal fences from the Diagonal Fences mod will also become unconnected from eachother after the update, but these blocks can simply be broken & replaced after updating to fix this.
